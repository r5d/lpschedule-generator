Edward Snowden is a former intelligence officer who served the CIA,
NSA, and DIA for nearly a decade as a subject matter expert on
technology and cybersecurity. In 2013, he revealed the NSA was
unconstitutionally seizing the private records of billions of
individuals who had not been suspected of any wrongdoing, resulting in
the largest debate about reforms to US surveillance policy
since 1978. Today, he works on methods of enforcing human rights
through the application and development of new technologies. He joined
the board of Freedom of the Press Foundation in February 2014. <span

Richard is a software developer and software freedom activist. In 1983
he announced the project to develop the <a href="https://gnu.org">GNU
operating system</a>, a Unix-like operating system meant to be
entirely free software, and has been the project's leader ever
since. With that announcement Richard also launched the Free Software
Movement. In October 1985 he started the Free Software Foundation.

Since the mid-1990s, Richard has spent most of his time in political
advocacy for free software, and spreading the ethical ideas of the
movement, as well as campaigning against both software patents and
dangerous extension of copyright laws. Before that, Richard developed
a number of widely used software components of GNU, including the
original Emacs, the GNU Compiler Collection, the GNU symbolic debugger
(gdb), GNU Emacs, and various other programs for the GNU operating
system.

Bassam is a 3D animator/filmmaker whose 2006 short, Elephants Dream,
was the first "open movie." It established the viability of libre
tools in a production environment and set precedent by offering its
source data under a permissive license for learning, remixing and
re-use. His character, ManCandy, began as an easily animatable test
bed for rigging experiments. Multiple iterations have been released to
the public, and Bassam demonstrates him in the animated tutorial
video + short, The ManCandy FAQ. Under the sign of the urchin, Bassam
is continuing to pursue a model of production that invests in
commonwealth. He teaches, writes and lectures around the world on free
production and free software technique. Raised in Damascus, Bassam
trained in the United States as an electrical and software engineer.
