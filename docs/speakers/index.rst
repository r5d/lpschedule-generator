Speaker's ID generation
+++++++++++++++++++++++

The last name of the speaker is automatically made the ID; if a
speaker' name is "John Hacker", the ID for this speaker will be
``hacker``.

- If two or more speakers have the same last name, then, the first
  speaker will have their last name as their ID and from the second to
  the n^th speaker will have their full name as their ID; if "Bill
  Hacker" and "Jill Hacker" are two speakers, "Bill" will get
  ``hacker`` as his ID and "Jill" will get ``jill_hacker`` as her ID.

- The IDs are transliterated to ASCII; if a speaker' name is "John
  HÃ–cker", the ID for this speaker will be ``hacker``.
